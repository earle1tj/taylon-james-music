          <h2>Whispered Truths</h2>
          <p className="book-lede">Two rival towns. Two teenage boys. One truth neither of them is ready to say out loud.</p>
          <p>
            Tyler and Hunter meet across the lanes of a worn-in Midwestern bowling
            alley. What begins as a glance grows into a tender story of first love,
            identity, secrets, and what happens when the future refuses to follow the
            version you imagined.
